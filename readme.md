This is openFrameworks addon is based on Jason Saragih's FaceTracker library.

[openFrameworks](http://openFrameworks.cc/) is an open source toolkit for creative coding.

FaceTracker is open source for non-commercial use, and is available [from Jason directly](http://web.mac.com/jsaragih/FaceTracker/FaceTracker.html). One you have Jason's source, you'll need to drop it in `libs/` (e.g., `libs/Tracker/Tracker.h`). You'll also need to drop the model data in `bin/data/model/`.

If you would like to prototype an idea involving face tracking, I encourage you to download [FaceOSC](https://github.com/downloads/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/FaceOSC.zip).
